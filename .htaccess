# first rule
# the following checks for a given URL (such as /file) and sees if /file.html exists. if it does exist, then it applies the rewrite rule which will redirect to /file.html
# HOWEVER, the URL will not include the .html even though it has been redirected to it. 
# example: raspitt.org/mprw displays raspitt.org/bleh.html file but the URL will remain as raspitt.org/bleh
