    Post Heading: Newsletter October 2016: Motion Control
    Post Description: Many robotics projects involve controlling a car-like robot to accomplish some task. Examples include last year’s Micromouse (below), Line Follower, and Sumo projects.

    While each robot has different characteristics and is destined to accomplish a different goal, one thing is the same. They all have wheels. They all need motion control.

    Often times in computer science, we find that many projects have the need to solve a similar problem, yet each project has been developing its own solution. This indicates duplicated or “wasted” effort, because the projects could be sharing code where their tasks overlap.

    The goal of the Motion Control project is to study control theory surrounding car-like robots, to identify common elements and concepts surrounding these robots, and then to develop a practically useful library or “toolkit” for a potentially large audience. We want to develop a robust and easy to use strategy for getting a car-like robot up and running, so that the developer can quickly and effectively move past the task of motion control and continue on to solving the larger high-level problem (such as following a line or solving a maze).

    This project involves a fairly wide scope of skills and knowledge:

    C++ programming, compilation, libraries
    Version control (git)
    PID, feed-forward, and self-tuning control theory
    Adaptability to feedback from unknown sources
    Physics surrounding linear and rotational motion
    Mechanical and electronic design
    Use of diverse computer systems (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, UNIX, Windows...)
    As a proof of concept, we would like to design three physically and electronically diverse robots and then load the same program onto each one, demonstrating how our project might adapt to different robots. Above all, we’re here to learn.

    Post Heading: Newsletter October 2016: Scorpion
    Post Description: The Scorpion is currently in the design phase. We will be finishing up preliminary designs and picking out parts in the next couple of weeks. The end goal of this project is to design and build a scorpion bot that can mimic the natural motions of a real scorpion. In addition we are hoping to be able to interface it with a myo band, so we can control the bot through our hand gestures. In order to make it more of a challenge we have decided to use one of the TI microcontrollers in place of the usual arduino or teensy. In addition to using the TI chip we would like to design a pcb for the chip, so we will be able to remove any unnecessary ports and pins. The code will be written in C and will be mostly firmware and servo control heavy.

Sailbot
Subheading: An autonomous sailbot.
Page Heading: SAILBOT
LEADERS: Kaylene Stocking, Woody Fulmer, Jeremy Manin, & Jay Maier
Synopsis
SailBot is an autonomous sailboat made to compete in the annual International Robotic Sailing Competition. This competition, which occurs in the early summer, tests various aspects of the sailboat’s design, including: speed of navigation, ability to maintain position, ability to locate and avoid obstacles, and maximum allowable payload. After the competition, the robot will be retrofitted to perform autonomous water testing in Pittsburgh’s rivers.

    Post Heading: Thoughts on Hull Design
    Post Description:Looking at the kinds of things a boat in the Sailbot competition will have to do, it seems like being successful will be more determined by things like how well you can plot a course, perceive the world around you, and decide when to tack than on achieving an absolute minimum form drag. This is most clear for tasks such as collision avoidance, searching an area, keeping a station, and navigating to a waypoint. With this in mind, we will be doing anything we can to construct a platform which can deliver high quality sensor information to our perception team and which can maneuver in a predictable and responsive way. In particular, this decision has led us to develop a wide-beam multihull.

    Historically in the Sailbot competition it has been popular to copy the design decisions made by the people building racing rc yachts in the Marblehead class. In particular, this has led to a proliferation of designs which derive their righting moment from a deep keel with a heavy bulb at the bottom. We have moved away from this because even though a deep keel design probably decreases form drag, the righting moment associated with a heavy build on a long central keel goes with the sine of the heel angle which means that you’re always sailing at significant heel angles. Our multihull design gets a righting moment that goes with the cosine of the heel angle, which means that we get a significant righting moment at a low heel angle which should mean that at low wind speeds we will be rock solid. The team we have working on vision tells us that this stability will be crucial in being able to parse the data that they will be getting from the cameras. Because we have sacrificed the emergency righting moment that the deep keel design grants, we will be designing our rig to work at wind speeds much higher than those expected for the competition. In particular this means that we will be designing the boat to flip in the worst configuration of rudder, sail, and wind direction at 30 knots. Any compartments holding water-sensitive electronics will be tested to stay watertight for 30 minutes while completely submerged. Unless something really exciting is going on (i.e. surprise tornado), we’re pretty confident that we’ll be able to right the boat in well under that 30 minute mark. Software side, we will have emergency conditions which will swing our bow into the wind and let out the sheet if we get close to our critical heel angle. In addition, this inability to recover from a flip has lead us towards a gaff rig. This is attractive because it gets the center of effort down towards the waterline which again decreases heeling moment while not losing sail area. Though we’ve decided to go with a gaff rig for now, we realise that we as a group aren't the most seasoned sailors and recognise the possibility that we could be totally wrong about that. With this in mind, we will be building the boat so that different rigs can be easily swapped in and out. Even though we really think the gaff rig will be better for our particular situation, there’s probably a reason pretty much every performance sailboat has a bermuda rig.

Artbot
Subheading: An artistic robot with some form of robotic movement.
Page Heading: ARTBOT
LEADERS: James Braza & Jon Kenneson
Synopsis
The goal of Artbot is to create a robotic panther that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing that will be displayed in the lobby of Benedum Hall. We have developed custom Arduino libraries to control the series of motors and actuators in the Panther as well as incorporated facial detection software to allow the panther to “see” and track people by moving its head. We also created an accompanying touchscreen kiosk/user interface to allow current and prospective students to interact with the panther and learn more information about the university.

    Post Header: Newsletter October 2016: Artbot
    Post Description: This past month, Artbot has accomplished as much as it did in an entire semester last year.

    We realized that a major area to improve in was leadership and giving members interesting projects. Team members were entrusted with an integral aspect of the panther that they are 100% in charge of. All projects involve a combination of ME, COE, and EE principles. For example, one person was tasked with making the eyes of the panther. This includes CS for the camera’s software, EE for communications with the camera and motor control of eyelids, and the ME design work/fabrication for the eye assembly.

    The projects are administered through Trello, a good ‘To Do’ list software. We have multiple boards, split up by the team’s needs. Additionally, we realized we cannot effectively delegate tasks to our members and contribute substantially to the project. Due to these facts, we assigned multiple people as chairs to lead sub-teams within the overall team. We delegate overarching goals to the chairs, who in turn work with the rest of the members for specific tasks to accomplish.

    On the computer side of things, Artbot has made much progress in the logic of fluid motion control of our motors. We have developed a variety of functions for controlling linear actuators, and servos. We are able to control the exact position and variable speed of the motors; allowing us to create a fluid movement of the motor instead of just a constant speed applied to the device. This is more representative of movement obtained from an animal, and will lead to a more realistic version of our robotic panther. We are in the process of developing libraries for these motors that will ease our efforts in coding once we have the limbs constructed.

    The arm, ear, and eye CAD models have been completed. The jaw is nearly complete. The head is projected to be fully prototyped within a month. The arm BOM is complete and is ready for fabrication. There is a team of three working on making neck prototypes

    The user interface design for the touchscreen of the kiosk has also seen improvement. We have a sleek, engineering-centric design for the main menu with rotating cogs as buttons leading to separate areas of the kiosk, as can be seen below. The separate sections of the kiosk are currently being designed and implemented and will be detailed further in a subsequent newsletter.
