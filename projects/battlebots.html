                                <h2>Overview</h2>
                                <p>Robot Combat is an emerging, tech-driven sport in which builders control robots equipped with innovative weapons and 
                                    ingenious defenses. Builders arm their bots with everything from flamethrowers to spinning saw blades, guaranteeing 
                                    a spectacle and an entertaining experience for everyone. Bots go head-to-head in an enclosed cage with the goal of 
                                    knocking each other out of commission. Robots are given three minutes in each round, during which either one of the 
                                    robots "taps out", is knocked out or the clock runs out, and goes to a judges' decision. Builders repair their robots 
                                    between each match until they&apos;re eliminated, or crowned the champion.</p>

                                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                                <p>Pitt RAS robotics project will build and design a battle bot for the NHRL competition and maybe at a few local 
                                    competitions in Pittsburgh. Team Members will use a new online platform called Onshape for designing the bot. 
                                    The students will get a chance to fabricate, assemble, and battle the bot. Background information needed to know 
                                    before joining the project would be to just watch an NHRL battle video on Youtube to get a sense of what it is like.
                                        Also, going over the safety regulations and rules is something all members should know about before starting the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project is fun and gives the teammates an opportunity to travel and learn how robotics work. You get to destroy
                                     other teams with your bot but that requires having a good team with good communication and to have the bot work 
                                     as a whole rather than separate parts not working together.
                                </p>
                                <p>Designs will follow the Combat Robotics Handbook by <a href="repeat-robotics.com">Repeat Robotics</a>. The team is broken up into multiple subteams: 
                                    power distribution, drivetrain, weapon design, and frame assembly.
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The hardware section consists of setting up the 3D printed frame with 3D printed mounts and components to hold the bot together. 
                                    The inside consists of a designed weapon and components of the power and drive system like LiPo batteries, transmitter, receiver, motors, wheels.

                                <h2>How to Join</h2>
                                <p>Just message us! No experience is necessary to join and students of all backgrounds are welcome. This includes (but is not limited to) computer
                                     engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering.  The project will involve a whole variety of people. We are 
                                     going to need a group of people designing it. A group of people physically making it. A group of people working on the drive system, and
                                      another group working on the weapon assembly. We are also gonna need someone who will do more art work and create us cool shirts to wear
                                       to the competition and to create us a logo for the bot. The biggest requirement to join the team is to have a passion for robotics and
                                        want to build the best battle bot. See our <a href="../contact">contact page</a> for how to reach us.</p>
