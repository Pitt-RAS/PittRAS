// TO DO LIST //
[ ] Add pitt ras logo as the symbol for the Website
[ ] Post to original URL (update CNAME)
[ ] Update URL on the readme file
[ ] Update readme file on how to update the Website (the links on the local vs published copy will definitely have to be mentioned.)
[ ] Complete contact page
[ ] Complete indy page
[ ] complete projects page
[ ] Complete sponsors page, was thinking like making a grid with all the sponsorss and have their logo be different sizes at the top, like fuck with column settings. 
        then describe tiers underneath.
[ ] Fix the sponsors sizing in the footer, do stacked as saba mentioned. FIX THE MOBILITAS LOGO 
[ ] Complete workshops page
[ ] Complete landing page
[ ] Add google analytics
[ ] Remove .html extension, when navigating through the site
        A link like https://pittras.org/PittRAS/subpages/indy works though (without the html), but if you navigate through the menu, it will add it
        See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-remove-html-extension-from-url-of-a-static-page/

        Okay it works but there will be a difference navigating it locally vs online. So will need to keep udpating each time before publishing
        need to put this somewhere in the readme file? 
        make a script for this? 
[X] Fix nav menu to be following order, home, about us, projects, Autonomous challenge, workshops, sponsors, contact/get involved
[X] MIT-PITT-RW page instead of autonmous racing page. url should be MIT-PITT-RW, probably do lowercase.
[ ] Add section to about us for media coverage (if its out of place move it to seperate page)
[ ] Pitt CES press release somewhere. ADD HIGHLIGHTS SECTION ON THE HOME PAGE??? 
[X] instead of saying like we've been wokring on somehting big.... why not combine that into the videO??? think that will look way cleaner.


home page could be like:
animated startup
quick about section / club mission
indy section
navigation buttons for indy section (learn more, how to join, become a sponsor)
f1tenth
sponsors
some quick contact links/footer


indy page
working on something big intro
who are we
goals/ project overview
how to join
technical stuff and details 
media coverage
