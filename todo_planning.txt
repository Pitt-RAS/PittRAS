// TO DO LIST //
[X] Add pitt ras logo as the symbol for the Website
[ ] Post to original URL (update CNAME)
[ ] Update URL on the readme file
[ ] Update readme file on how to update the Website (the links on the local vs published copy will definitely have to be mentioned.)
[ ] Check the size of the old repo and see if it is feasible to include in the old repo in the new repo as a website archive.
[X] Complete contact page
[ ] Need a google form for RAS recruiting on the contact page.
[X] need to add sponsor descriptions on the sponsor page. Logos should probably be links to the sponsor website as well? 
        Iâ€™d also put a short description of the company (logo on left side) with link to the company site for the sponsor page. 
        The description can be grabbed from the company site
[X] Complete mit-pitt-rw page layout
[X] complete projects page
[ ] Fix padding on mobile for projects page.
[ ] Consider redoing setup on mobile for project page. images are way too small now. but fix general website formatting first before you do this
[ ] Consider redoing setup on mobile for sponsors page. logos are way too small now. but fix general website formatting first before you do this
[ ] complete project subpages
[ ] fix the look on a horizontal screen. it was way too stretched out and the font is way too big
        try playing around with the font size and inner class width. ideally you want the vertical monitor look to match
        the horizontal monitor look but without stretching it so wide that it just looks plain and boring. use
        old RAS website as a guide. ask shane for input
[X] Complete sponsors page, was thinking like making a grid with all the sponsorss and have their logo be different sizes at the top, like fuck with column settings. 
        then describe tiers underneath.
[X] Fix the sponsors sizing in the footer, do stacked as saba mentioned. FIX THE MOBILITAS LOGO 
[X] Fix the padding on mobile for the sponsor logo stack 
[ ] Complete workshops page
[X] Complete landing page layout
[ ] Add google analytics
[ ] Remove .html extension, when navigating through the site
        A link like https://pittras.org/PittRAS/subpages/indy works though (without the html), but if you navigate through the menu, it will add it
        See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-remove-html-extension-from-url-of-a-static-page/

        Okay it works but there will be a difference navigating it locally vs online. So will need to keep udpating each time before publishing
        need to put this somewhere in the readme file? 
        make a script for this? 

        I feel like theres an easier way to do this. can the server just rewrote to the same page but removing the .html
        instead of removing that locally, and making the server add it on the server side? cause that already works. 

[X] Fix nav menu to be following order, home, about us, projects, Autonomous challenge, workshops, sponsors, contact/get involved
[X] MIT-PITT-RW page instead of autonmous racing page. url should be MIT-PITT-RW, probably do lowercase.
[X] Add section to about us for media coverage (if its out of place move it to seperate page)
[X] Pitt CES press release somewhere. 
[ ] ADD HIGHLIGHTS SECTION ON THE HOME PAGE??? like lidar stuff? our car driving? any other kind of videos?
[X] instead of saying like we've been wokring on somehting big.... why not combine that into the videO??? think that will look way cleaner.
[X] Add Skydio as a sponsor
[X] fix padding for the mit-pitt-rw page on mobile
